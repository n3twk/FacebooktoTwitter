# FacebooktoTwitter
Import a post from Facebook page and tweet it on Twitter

You need to get API keys for Twitter account and in order to do that you will need a developer account, go to:

https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new 

Add the required API credentials in the code (replace the get_from_twitter) and run it :)
