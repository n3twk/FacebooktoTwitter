# FacebooktoTwitter
Import a post from Facebook page and tweet it on Twitter

You need to get API keys for Twitter account and in order to do that you will need a developer account, go to:

https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new 

1- Add the required API credentials in the code (replace the get_from_twitter).
2- Replace PageName with the name of the page you want to scrape post from.
3-Replace Text_from_post with part of the text from the Facebook post you intend to tweet.

Run the script :)
